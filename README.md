# Codeforces-Raif-ML-Round-1
a Codeforces ML competition

Basically I cleaned the data and trained a simple model in Data Preprocessing and Training.ipynb. Then I wrote the function to simulate Codeforces testing and judging in main.ipynb. So now we are good with the basic stuff and ready to do basic testing on the model we may develop.

Next step would be develop a more sophistictated ML model to increase the accuracy of prediction. Feel free to try train a Neural Net to solve it.

Also feel free to take a look at the documentation in the Jupyter Notebook and the code to figure out exactly how I cleaned the data and wrote the testing function.
